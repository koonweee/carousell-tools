# TODO list
* Navigating search result pages (currently, each search returns 40 results per page at maximum)
* Visit specific categories (eg. Computer Parts & Accesories, Audio etc)
* Confirm order of search results (ensure bumped/boosted listings are not shown before more recent listings)
* Abstraction into separate classes for modularity
* Store and load records for a search to a CSV (+ user can modify in Excel) or SQL database
* Filter out bumped listings
